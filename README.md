# Ratl (Real-time Audio Template Library)

Ratl (pronounced rattle) is a C++ header-only library that is designed to help with the processing of real-time audio
data. It does this by providing clear and unambiguous types to hold and represent audio data as well as fast and easy
ways to convert audio data between these various types.

## Features

Support for:
1. 16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit integer, and 32 bit floating point samples
1. Host byte order and network byte order samples
1. Interleaved and non-interleaved audio buffers
1. Optional sample dithering when converting any samples to 16 bit integer samples or when converting floating point
   samples to integer samples
